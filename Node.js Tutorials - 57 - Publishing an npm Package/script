for the final video in this section on npm let's learn how to publish a package to the npm registry.
the package we are going to publish is the same code we've been working with so far.
a simple function that greets a user.
to publish a package you just have to run one command npm space publish.
however before doing that you need to create an account on npmgs and sign into that account in vs code.
I won't be doing that in this video but let me point out the steps.
first head over to npmgs.com and click on sign up.
enter a username email address and password.
a one-time password will be sent to your email which you will need to enter in the next screen.
once that is successfully completed head back to vs code.
in the terminal run the command npm space add user all in lowercase followed by your username.
this is the same username you would have entered on npm Js.
when you press enter it will prompt you for your password and email address.
when you successfully complete that step you're ready to publish your package.
now in the terminal run the command.
npm publish.
if it succeeds you can head over to https npmgs.com package followed by the packaged name.
greet hyphen code evolution.
the value of the name Field in package.json.
here you should be able to see your ownnode.js project in the npm registry publicly available for anyone to download and use.
the installation command is autogenerated by npm.
to verify this I'm going to create a new folder new package navigate inside new package run npm in it dash dash yes.
which creates a package.json file.
next I'm going to run npm install or I for short followed by greet hyphen code evolution.
we have our package added as a dependency.
I'm going to create index.js.
import create code evolution.
and call greet passing in a name.
if we now run node index.
we see hello vishwas welcome to code Evolution and this is because I forgot to comment out the grid statement in my custom package index.js.
the second statement though hello Batman welcome to code evolution is from our new package.
with that we come to the end of this section on npm.
we have learned what is npm why do we need it about package.json which is the configuration file how to install and use npm packages about dependencies package versioning Global packages creating and running our own npm scripts and finally publishing a package to the registry.
now these are topics I felt were essential to cover for someone who is starting out with node.js.
for further learning please head over to docs.npmgs.com.
all right thank you for watching please do consider subscribing to the channel.
and I'll see you in the next one"
