"in the previous video we enhanced ourbasic CLI to accept options from thecommand linewe can run the commandcode Evolution Pokedex followed by thePokemon option and a value for thatoptionalthough this is great what would beeven better is if the CLI wasinteractive prompting us to enter aPokemon namethat way as a user we don't have torefer to the manual to understand whatoptions have to be passed in to make theCLI workin this video Let's understand how toskip passing the Pokemon option andinstead prompt the user for a PokemonnameStep 1 I'm going to comment out coderelated to the arcs package as we don'tplan to pass in any optionStep 2 we're going to install an npmpackage that allows us to addinteractivity to our CLIthere are quite a few packages out therebut I am going to use a package calledInquirerin the terminal run the command npminstallInquirerat 8.2.5Version 9 only works with es modules soI'm going to install version 8 whichalso supports common JS module formatwhen the command completesthe package should be listed as adependencystep 3 Let's import and use the packagein index.jsat the top const Inquireris equal to require Inquirernext after the print 5 Moves functionwe're going to add the code related tointeractivitynow you should refer to the docs for abetter understanding about Inquirer butlet me go over this one line at a timefirst we create a prompt moduleconst prompt is equal to Inquirer dotcreate prompt modulenext we invoke this prompt functionreturned from create prompt moduleto this function we pass in an array ofquestions we want to ask the userwe just have the one question and eachquestion is an object in this arraywe specify typewhich is inputname for the questionthis is going to be Pokemonand the actual question that the userseesenter a Pokemon name to view its firstfive moveswhen the user replies with an answer tothis question it is returned back to usfor processingprompt does return a promise thoughwe can use then blockto capture and use the answerArrow functionwe receive all the answersand we're going to extractjust Pokemonhere Pokemon refers to the name propertyin the next linewe call this print 5 Moves functionpassing in the answer that the userprovidedand that is pretty much itin the terminal we can now runcode Evolution Pokedexand it starts our CLI in an interactivemodeit prompts the question enter a Pokemonname to view its first five movesI'm going to enter Dragoniteand we see the five moves locked in theterminalreally simple as you can seeall right this is pretty much what Iwanted to cover about building CLI toolswe learned that CLI stands for commandline interface and is a program we canrun from the terminalwe learned how to pass options whichintroduces some Dynamic behavior and wealso learned how to add interactivity toa CLI toolof course what we've learned in thissection barely scratches the surface ofwhat is possible with a CLI built usingnode and npmthis is a topic I would recommend youExplore More so you can build a fewtools that can help you in yourday-to-day workflowwith that we come to the end of thisshort section on building CLI tools withnode and npmthank you for watching please doconsider subscribing to the channel andI'll see you in the next one"
