welcome back in this video let's learn about npm Scripts.
an npm script is a convenient way to bundle common commands for use in a project.
they are typically entered in the command line in order to do something with the application.
npm scripts are stored in a Project's package.json file giving access to everyone who has access to the code base.
they also ensure that everyone is using the same command with the same options.
common use cases for npm scripts include building your project starting a Dev server compiling CSS linting minifying Etc.
npm scripts are executed using the command npm run followed by the script name.
let's head back to vs code and take a look at an example.
when we run the command npm in it it generates a scripts Field in package.json.
this contains a test script that just prints to the console now test is specified.
this is not so useful so let's add one on our own.
let's create a simple script that is going to run our node application.
which is of course index.js in our scenario.
the script name I'm going to call it start.
and the command this script is going to run is nodeindex.js.
save the file and in the terminal within the project folder run the command npm Run start.
this will run index.js and give us the expected output hello vishwas welcome to code evolution
now a start script is something you would typically see in every project it helps everyone in the team get started easily without having to understand all the commands that need to be run.
at the moment it is just node index but in an Enterprise scale application the start script might be a combination of several commands.
but you as a developer always have to remember just one script npm Run start in fact start is a special script which allows you to directly run npm start.
Led you get back the same output.
now there is a lot more to writing scripts but from a beginner's perspective for learning node.js this isa good start.
