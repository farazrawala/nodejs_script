"in the previous video we learned aboutthe cluster module which helps withperformance Improvement in a nodeapplicationin this video let's learn about theworker threads module which also helpswith the same causethe worker threats module enables theuse of threads that execute JavaScriptin parallelcode executed in a worker thread runs ina separate child process preventing itfrom blocking your main applicationbut how is this module different fromthe cluster modulewell the cluster module can be used torun multiple instances of node.js thatcan distribute workloadswork a threads module on the other handallows running multiple applicationthreads within a single node.js instancewhen process isolation is not neededthere is no separate instances of V8event Loop and memory are needed youshould use worker threadslet's head back to vs code andunderstand its usage with an exampleI'm going to create a new file calledMain thread.jsand within the file I'm going to paste acode snippetnow this is 99 the same code we had seenin the previous videowe create an HTTP server and handle tworoutesa home page route and a slow page routethe slope is Route is one that has asmall modificationI have introduced a variable called Jwhich I increment within the for Loopafter the for Loop is donethe J variable is returned as part ofthe response textwe then listen on Port 8000.let's now run node main thread in theterminaland head to the browseronce again I'm going to navigate to boththe routes with the network panel openvisit home pageand we see this takes 10 millisecondsnavigate to slash slow pageand we see this takes five secondswe also see the value of J beingreturnedif I reload this slow page quickly andreload the home pageyou see the home page is indeed blockedwhile the first request is being servedit has taken 4.7 secondsslow page 5.7 secondsthere is room for performanceImprovement and this is where the workerthreads module comes into picturelet me explain the necessary changesin main thread we are going to importthe worker threads modulewe destructurethe worker Constructornext we are going to alter the slow pageroutefirst we create a new worker threadusing the worker functionconst worker is equal tonew workerto this function we pass in path to aworker file as argumentdot slashworker thread.jswe don't have this file yet so let'screate itnext we're going to move the longoperation from the main thread and placeit in the worker threadcut and pastebut what we are going to do now is sendthe value of this variable J back to themain threadfor that we once again rely on theworker threads modulecopy paste itbut this time we import the parent Portobjectafter the for Loopwe call parent Port dot post messagepassing in the value of Jnow we can listen to messages in themain thread using the message eventworker dot onmessageand we have a callback functionwe get access to the data passed backwhich is the variable Jand we will respond with that valueand that is pretty much itlet's restart the serverand head back to the browserif we now reload the slow pageand quickly reload the home pageyou can see the home page only takes twomillisecondsit is not blocked by the slow page whichhas taken five secondswe also see the value of J beingdisplayed which is a value sent from theworker thread to the main threadas you can see the worker threads moduleoffers something similar to the threadpoolit's not true multi-threading but itlets you execute code in paralleloutside the main threada good use case for using worker threadsmodule is when you have to resize imagesor videos or even perhaps encrypt fileswhat we have seen here is a mereintroduction to the worker threadsmodulethere is a lot more to it and I suggestyou go through the documentation whenyou have the timebut for now thank you for watching andI'll see you in the next video"
