welcome back in this video Let's briefly understand what libuv is all about.
and we are going to do this by understanding the what why and how of Libya B.
first up what is Libuv.
libuv is a cross-platform open source Library written in C language.
why do we need libuv.
well Libby V is what handles asynchronous non-blocking operations innode.js.
it abstracts away all the complexity of dealing with the operating system.
how does it do that using two very important features namely thread pool and event Loop.
of course there's a lot more to libuev than just these two features but as beginners thread pool and event Loop are more than sufficient to help us form amental model of how node handles asynchronous code.
and you guessed it we will be learning about these two features in detail.
in the next video let's start with the thread pool"
