"welcome to the seventh section in thiscourse on node.js for beginners in thissection we are going to learn how tobuild CLI tools with node and npmhaving gone through the previous sectionyou are probably aware what is a CLI butlet me briefly explain in two sentencesCLI stands for command line interfaceand is basically a program that you canrun from the terminaltwo very popular clis include npm whichwe have already come across and theother one is git which is a VersionControl Systemin this section our goal is to create avery simple CLI using node.jsin this particular video I will show youhow to create a basic CLI tool usingnode and npmin the next video I will show how topass options to the CLIin the third video I will show how toadd interactivity to the CLIif that makes sense let's head back tovs code and get started withimplementing a basic CLInow creating a CLI is similar tocreating an npm package with a few extrastepsso for step one let's initialize a newnpm projectI'm going to create a new foldercalled mycustom CLIin the terminal I'm going to navigateinto the project folderand run the command npm init dash dashyesthis will generate a new package.jsonwith default values within our my customCLI folderin the package.json file I'm going tochange the project nameto code evolutionPokedexspoiler alert we will be making use ofthe Pokemon API in the next videodo make sure that your package name isunique npm will not let you publish itto the registry if a package alreadyexists with the same nameall right for Step 2 let's write thecode we want to execute when we run theCLI commandSo within the same folder create a newfile index.jsand for now let's add one log statementthat sayscode Evolution Pokedexall right for the third and final stepwe convert this package into a CLIand that requires two additionsfirst in index.jsat the top we addhash symbol exclamation slash user slashWin slash EnV space nodethis is called hashbank or shibang whichtells the operating system whichinterpreter to usein our case we specifynode as The Interpreter and the locationwhere node is installedsecond in package.json we add a newfield called binthe bin field basically allows us totreat our package as an executable filewhich can be installed into the pathvariablethe value is an object which containskey value pairsASCII we specify the command we want toexecute to run our CLIin our case I will call itco-revolution Pokedexthe value to this key is the entry pointto the CLIthat is index.jsand that is pretty much it we havecreated our first CLI toolto test it as a CLI we need to installthis packagenow you may think we need to publishthis package to the registry and installitwell there is a simpler way from withinthe project folder you can runsudo npm installGI'm not specified the package name asyou can see and Sudo is not required ifyou're on Windowswhen you run this commandnpm will install our CLI tool globallyand during the installation it will comeacross this bin fieldand register the code Evolution Pokedexcommand which will run index.jsonce the command completeswe can run code Evolution hyphen Pokedexin the terminal press enterand visit the log statement fromindex.js code Evolution Pokedexreally simple as you can seein the next video let's add some logicand understand how to pass options torclithank you for watching please doconsider subscribing to the channel andI'll see you in the next one"
