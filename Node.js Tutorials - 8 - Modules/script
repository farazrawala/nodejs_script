"welcome back in this second section of the course let's learn about modules in node.js.
 a module is an encapsulated and reusable chunk of code that has its own context.
 in node.js each file is treated as a separate module.
 in total we have three different types of modules.
 first we have local modules modules.
 that we create in our application.
 second we have built-in modules modules that node ships with out of the box.
 finally we have third-party modules which refer to modules written by other developers that we can use in our application.
 we are going to take a closer look at each of the module types in the series but in this very section our focus is only on local modules modules.
 that we as developers create and share within our application.
 if you're still unclear as to what a module is join me in the next video where we will create and use our first module in node. Js.
 I'll see you in the next one"
